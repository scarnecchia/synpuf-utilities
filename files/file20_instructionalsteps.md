## Instructional Steps  
The following steps are for using the pre-parameterized CIDA package. 

1.	Review the SynPUFs [Technical Specification](https://dev.sentinelsystem.org/projects/SYNPUF/repos/synpuf_user_documentation/browse/Sentinel_Tech_Spec_SynPUF_to_SCDM_v1.0.pdf) before proceeding.
2.	Please make sure your computer meets all the minimal system requirements before proceeding.
