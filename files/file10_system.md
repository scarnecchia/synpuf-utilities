##	DEMONSTRATION SENTINEL CIDA PACKAGE  

A demonstration Sentinel CIDA package was developed to demonstrate the ability to execute the CIDA tool on SCDM-formatted SynPUFs datasets. Currently, the data available for the SCDM-formatted SynPUFs is for dates of service from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. The version of the CIDA tool used is version 5.3.1. The demonstration package used a retrospective new-user cohort design.  

###	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  

For CIDA to run successfully, you must have on your PC:  

#### Software Requirements  

*  Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.3 or higher  

#### Space Requirements  

*  Minimum disk space of 2.65GB (per subsample)
*  User can optionally combine up to 20 subsamples to form one dataset; therefore, calculation of disk space is required before downloading the desired number of subsamples.
